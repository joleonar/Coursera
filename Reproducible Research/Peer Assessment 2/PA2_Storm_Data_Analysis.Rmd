## Storms and other severe weather events on public health and economic in the United States

### Synopsis
In this report we aim to describe which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health and have the greatest economic consequences across the United States. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011.

Our overall hypothesis address the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

From these data, we found that, the most damaging weather event in terms of FATALITIES and INJURIES is "TORNADO". When it comes to greatest economic consequences in terms of properties and crops, "FLOOD" is the most damaging to properties and "DROUGHT" is the most damaging to Crops.

### Data Processing
First we need to download and load the data into R. First part of the code we load al necessaries libraries. Second part is a check, before downloading, if the file we want to download already exists. Third part is read the data into a object type.

```{r cachedChunk, cache = TRUE}
## Loading the necessaries libraries
library(knitr)

## Download the storm data from NOAA
if (!file.exists("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")) {
    download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", "repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", method="libcurl")
}

## Load the storm data into variable 'stormData'
df <- read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")
class(df)
```

Now we have load the data into a data frame object. Letâ€™s take a look at the data we have loaded.

```{r}
dim(df)
names(df)
head(df, 3)
```

As we can see we have 902297 observations and 37 variables and all colomns have names.

According to the documentation of the database, there are 7 variables related to these questions:

- `EVTYPE` as a measure of event type (e.g. tornado, flood, etc.)
- `FATALITIES` as a measure of harm to human health
- `INJURIES` as a measure of harm to human health
- `PROPDMG` as a measure of property damage and hence economic damage in USD
- `PROPDMGEXP` as a measure of magnitude of property damage (e.g. thousands, millions USD, etc.)
- `CROPDMG` as a measure of crop damage and hence economic damage in USD
- `CROPDMGEXP` as a measure of magnitude of crop damage (e.g. thousands, millions USD, etc.)

Therefore, we create a two new data frames, `q1` and `q2`, with some of these 7 variables.

#### Prepare data for Question 1
1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

For this question we do not need the complete dataset, therefore we create a subset for this analysis and it's a lot faster exploration of the data than the complete dataset. We only need the variables `FATALITIES`, `INJURIES` and `EVTYPE` because we are answering which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health.

Create a subset for question 1 (`q1`).
```{r cache = TRUE}
q1 <- subset(df, select=c("FATALITIES","INJURIES","EVTYPE"))
```

Aggregrate `FATALITIES` and `INJURIES` by `EVTYP` with the `FUN` is `sum`.
```{r}
fatalities <- aggregate(FATALITIES ~ EVTYPE, q1, sum)
injuries <- aggregate(INJURIES ~ EVTYPE, q1, sum)
```

Descending order and get only top 12 else the list is to long.
```{r}
fatal_ord <- head(fatalities[order(-fatalities$FATALITIES),], 12)
injur_ord <- head(injuries[order(-injuries$INJURIES),], 12)
```

Show ordered data.
```{r}
fatal_ord
injur_ord
```

#### Prepare data for Question 2
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

For this question we also do not need the complete dataset, therefore we create a different subset for this analysis and it's a lot faster exploration of the data than the complete dataset. We need the variables `EVTYPE`, `PROPDMG`, `PROPDMGEXP`, `CROPDMG` and `CROPDMGEXP` because we are answering which types of events have the greatest economic consequences.

Create a subset for question 2 (`q2`).
```{r cache = TRUE}
q2 <- subset(df, select=c("EVTYPE", "PROPDMG", "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", "CROPDMGEXP" ))
```

**Note**: EXP = exponent

What are possible values of `CROPDMGEXP` and `PROPDMGEXP`.
```{r}
unique(q2$PROPDMGEXP)
unique(q2$CROPDMGEXP)
```

As we can see the possible values are: `- ? + 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 B h H K k m M, and blanks`. We only know the values for these variables:

- H,h = hundreds = 100
- K,k = kilos = thousands = 1,000
- M,m = millions = 1,000,000
- B,b = billions = 1,000,000,000

Convert these known values to numeric so we can calculate property and crop damage. We are multiplying `PROPDMG` with `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMG` with `CROPDMGEXP`.
```{r cache = TRUE}
q2$PROP_DAMAGE <- 0
q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "H",]$PROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "H",]$PROPDMG * 10^2
q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "K",]$PROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "K",]$PROPDMG * 10^3
q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "M",]$PROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "M",]$PROPDMG * 10^6
q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "B",]$PROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$PROPDMGEXP) == "B",]$PROPDMG * 10^9

q2$CROP_DAMAGE <- 0
q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "H",]$CROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "H",]$CROPDMG * 10^2
q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "K",]$CROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "K",]$CROPDMG * 10^3
q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "M",]$CROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "M",]$CROPDMG * 10^6
q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "B",]$CROP_DAMAGE <- q2[toupper(q2$CROPDMGEXP) == "B",]$CROPDMG * 10^9
```

Let's check if the calculate columns are numeric.
```{r}
class(q2$PROP_DAMAGE)
class(q2$CROP_DAMAGE)
```

As we can see the new columns `PROP_DAMAGE` and `CROP_DAMAGE` are of a numeric class, now we can create an aggregration.
```{r}
prop_damages <- aggregate(PROP_DAMAGE ~ EVTYPE, q2, sum)
crop_damages <- aggregate(CROP_DAMAGE ~ EVTYPE, q2, sum)
```

Descending order and get only top 12 else the list is to long:
```{r}
prop_dam_ord <- head(prop_damages[order(-prop_damages$PROP_DAMAGE),], 12)
crop_dam_ord <- head(crop_damages[order(-crop_damages$CROP_DAMAGE),], 12)
```

Show ordered data:
```{r}
prop_dam_ord
crop_dam_ord
```

### Results 

#### The results of question 1

Let's plot the data we created for question 1 into a barplot.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2), cex = 0.7, mar=c(12,4,4,2), las = 2)
barplot(
    fatal_ord$FATALITIES,
    names.arg = fatal_ord$EVTYPE,
    ylab = "Fatalities",
    main = "Fatalities by Event Type (top 12)",
    col = "lightblue"
)
barplot(
    injur_ord$INJURIES,
    names.arg = injur_ord$EVTYPE,
    ylab = "Injuries",
    main = "Injuries by Event Type (top 12)",
    col = "lightblue"
)
```

As we can see the most damage terms of fatalities and injuries is `Tornado`.

#### The results of question 2

Let's plot the data we created for question 2 into a barplot.

```{r}
# disable scientific notation 
options(scipen=999)

par(mfrow=c(1,2), cex = 0.7, mar=c(12,5,4,2), las = 2)
barplot(
    prop_dam_ord$PROP_DAMAGE/10^9,
    names.arg = prop_dam_ord$EVTYPE,
    ylab = "Property Damage ($ in Billions)",
    main = "Property Damage by Event Type (top 12)",
    col = "lightblue"
)
barplot(
    crop_dam_ord$CROP_DAMAGE/10^9,
    names.arg = crop_dam_ord$EVTYPE,
    ylab = "Crop Damage ($ in Billions)",
    main = "Crop Damage by Event Type (top 12)",
    col = "lightblue"
)
```

As we can see, "FLOOD" is the most damaging to properties and "DROUGHT" is the most damaging to Crops.
