## Question 4
##
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
## 
## Output:
## -------
## plot4.R end plot4.png

# This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Find coal combustion-related sources
