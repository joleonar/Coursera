## The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns.  Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers 
## should be fine).
##
## We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from 
## just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
## 
## You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime() and 
## as.Date() functions.
##
## Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?

# Load complete dataset
df <- read.csv("household_power_consumption.txt", 
               sep = ";", 
               colClasses = c("character", "character", rep("numeric",7)), 
               na="?")

# Create subset of data, we need only two days as described above
df <- subset(df, Date == "1/2/2007" | Date == "2/2/2007")

# Format Date and Time Columns
df$Time <- strptime(paste(df$Date, df$Time), "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
df$Date <- as.Date(df$Date,format="%d/%m/%Y")
